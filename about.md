Hello, I'm Karina. I have a slightly insane diet. On this website, I share
recipes I've adapted and my adventures making them.

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with [MS][]. After researching, particularly
after reading the [Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis][] book, I changed my diet
to cut out saturated fat, dairy and eggs (apart from egg white) as well as
meat (I was already a fish eating vegetarian).

I can't even begin to explain how many benefits this diet has had for me,
not just for my MS! But the truth is that from time to time I *really*
need to eat something *sweet*! So, this website is a chronicle of my efforts
to make food that I both crave and can actually eat.

Most of the recipes come from cookbooks and websites I tend to read on the
lookout for some nice new food to try. I'll post my own (rather bad!) pictures
with each recipe.

I hope you enjoy making some of the recipes. If you make something great or would like to share one of your own recipes, do [let me know :)][]
