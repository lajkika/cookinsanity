This bread is a bit like pizza only different :)

The original title of this bread is "Leek and Panceta Tray Bread" and it's from ["The Bread and Bread Machine Bible"][] by Christine Ingram and Jennie Shapter. I replaced several ingredients, the most obvious one being - panceta! I used the bread machine to make the dough (very convenient because it takes only 45 mins!). You can make the dough the traditional way too - it's just going to take a bit longer because of the time the dough needs for rising (ca. 30-40 mins). 

If you're using the bread machine to make the dough then just follow the usual way you put the ingredients in the pan and use the pizza or basic dough setting. When the dough is ready, put it on a lightly floured surface and knock it back (gently!) to get the air out. Then roll it out into a thin rectangle ca. 23x33 cm. Lightly oil a tin that is ca. 1 cm deep and ca. 20x30 cm (these are just for orientation, the tin I used is probably 25x30 cm). You might need to stretch the dough upwards a bit to cover the edges of the tin. Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.

Cook the onion, courgette and mushrooms in a pan with a tbsp of olive oil until they soften a bit - not longer than 5 mins. I always add a bit of water or other liquid like wine, stock etc. to the oil so it doesn't get too hot. Let the vegetables cool a bit. Mix the cream, milk and eggs together. The original recipe has 140 ml sour cream and 70 ml milk. I used a bit less because soy cream is not very thick and I didn't want the mixture to be too runny.
Put the vegetables on top of the prepared dough and then pour the milk, cream and egg mixture over them. Season with a bit of salt and pepper. I used some Italian seasoning as well. 

You can experiment with different vegetables and serve it on its own or with salads. We had it with brussels sprouts (I went sprout crazy!!!) and green salad.
