This omelette is my favourite for lunch! 

Accompanied by baked beans, green salad and chunky wholegrain bread it's just delicious and filling (at least for a couple of hours!:). You make it the same way you'd make your normal omelette. I put mushrooms, tomatoes and spinach (if using) in a medium frying pan with a drizzle of olive oil and water. Cook on medium high heat for a few minutes and stir occasionally. Beat the egg whites well with a fork. Try adding the egg whites to the pan before the mushrooms and spinach become soggy and let water out. Cook on one side for a minute or two then turn. I manage to flip the omelette but not always so sometimes I use a spatula instead. And sometimes it's a bit soggy so I turn it into a scramble.
