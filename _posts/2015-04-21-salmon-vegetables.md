This meal must be one of my favourites. I use any veg we have in the fridge that goes well with salmon. 

I think I also made so many times I'm getting to the stage where I don't overcook the salmon. Basically, you can make the salmon fillets which ever way you prefer and find easiest - bake, poach, grill, dry fry. This is what I find simplest: I put each salmon fillet onto a baking foil, add 1 finely sliced garlic clove, salt, pepper, dill if you like, some tomato, sometimes I drizzle it with a bit of white wine or lemon juice, add olive oil on it and then wrap the foil. The oven should be around 190 C and bake it for ca. 17 minutes (depends on the size of the fillet and thickness). 

The veg can, again, be prepared whichever way you like. I prefer steamed so I just chuck everything in a big colander and steam it - start with the carrots because they take longest and then add the others. I steam the carrots and brussels sprouts for about 4-5 mins and then add the beans for another few mins. It depends whether you like the veg crunchy or soft. As for the potatoes, baby new potatoes require least attention. If they are big potatoes, I cut them in cubes and cook them. Mashed potato works well in this recipe too.

The mushroom and spinach sauce is very simple too. If I have time, I chop an onion and a clove of garlic and cook it on a medium high heat with a bit of oil and some white wine/water. When the onion has softened, add the mushrooms and mix. Cook for a few minutes and then add the spinach. Mix and cook for a minute or two until the spinach is done. Then cool a little bit and transfer to a blender. Blend for 10-15 seconds. Pour back into the pan and heat over medium heat, add cream, mix and when it starts to boil, it's done. If I'm short on time, I just skip the blending and add the cream to spinach and mushrooms when they're cooked and it's equally nice. This is why I find this recipe so great - it's adaptable and can take 30 mins or up to 1 hour to make :)
